# generator-in-python
This file contains an example of Python generators using the yield keyword. Generators allow lazy evaluation and are memory-efficient for iterating over large datasets. Included basic usage and comparison with regular functions.
🔹 What is a Generator?
Generators are special functions that return an iterator and allow lazy evaluation. Instead of returning all values at once, they yield values one by one using yield.

🔹 Why Use Generators?
- Memory efficient
- Suitable for large datasets
- Pauses execution and resumes on next iteration
- # Benifit of generator:
'''one the of the main benifit of generator is that
allow you generate the values on-the-fly,rather than
having to create  and store the entire sequence 
in memory.And the next() function is used to request 
the next value from the generator'''
